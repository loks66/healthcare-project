Information about the project :
 Medicure is a super specialty hospital based in New York, USA and provide world class treatment and surgery
 including Heart, Liver, Kidney transplants and first robotic surgery center. The chain is owned and managed by Global
 Health Limited. The Medicure would centrally like to manage all the doctor’s and patient’s data across the Medicure
 hospitals in various cities. They have developed an microservice, which offers these services. In order to reduce
 unnecessary maintenance cost and manual labor, they would like to automate their application build and deployment
 process using DevOps. They are fine to use any one of the (AWS, Azure, GCP) cloud platform as their primary cloud
 service provider. The company’s primary goal is to deliver the product updates frequently to production with High
 quality & Reliability. They also want to accelerate software delivery speed, quality and reduce feedback time between
 developers and testers. They would like to use Kubernetes to manage their container deployments, scaling and
 descaling of containers etc. Initially, Medicure is facing multiple problems, because of involved complexity in
 application as well as Infrastructure.

 **you need to implement Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment using following tools:** <br>
 **✓Git- For version control for tracking changes in the code files** <br>
 **✓Jenkins- For continuous integration and continuous deployment** <br>
 **✓Docker- For containerizing applications** <br>
 **✓ Ansible- Configuration management tools** <br>
 **✓Selenium- For automating tests on the deployed web application** <br>
 **✓Terraform- For creation of infrastructure.** <br>
 **✓Kubernetes– for running containerized application in managed cluster.** <br>
 This project will be about how to test the services and deploy code to dev/stage/prod etc, just on a click of button
